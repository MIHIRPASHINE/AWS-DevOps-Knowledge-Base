1. **What is HDD and SSD? Explain the difference between both storage types.**

   - **HDD (Hard Disk Drive):** HDDs are traditional mechanical storage devices that use spinning disks and magnetic heads to read and write data. They offer large storage capacities but are relatively slower due to mechanical components.

   - **SSD (Solid State Drive):** SSDs, on the other hand, are non-mechanical storage devices that use NAND-based flash memory for data storage. They are faster, more reliable, and energy-efficient compared to HDDs.

   - **Difference:** The main difference lies in the technology and speed. SSDs provide faster data access and transfer speeds compared to HDDs, making them ideal for performance-critical applications.

2. **What is throughput and IOPS? Explain the difference between the two.**

   - **Throughput:** Throughput refers to the amount of data that can be transferred over a network or processed by a system in a given amount of time. It is measured in bits per second (bps) or bytes per second.

   - **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second):** IOPS measures the number of read/write operations a storage system can perform in one second. It is crucial for assessing storage performance.

   - **Difference:** Throughput is focused on the overall data transfer rate, while IOPS specifically measures the number of input/output operations, emphasizing storage performance.
