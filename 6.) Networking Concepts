19. **What is HTTP? HTTP and HTTPS run on which port?**
    - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for transmitting hypertext. HTTP runs on port 80, while HTTPS (HTTP Secure) runs on port 443.

20. **Explain how HTTP works?**
    - HTTP facilitates communication between web clients and servers. It is a request-response protocol where clients request resources, and servers respond with the requested data.

21. **List and explain HTTP methods.**

    - GET: Retrieve data from the server.
    - POST: Submit data to the server.
    - PUT: Update a resource on the server.
    - DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.
    - PATCH: Partially update a resource.

22. **What is an IP address? What is the need for an IP address?**
    - An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device on a network. It is needed for identification and location addressing in the network.

23. **What is IPv4 and IPv6? Explain the difference.**
    - IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses. IPv6 was introduced to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and to provide enhanced features.

24. **What is a private IP address and public IP address? Explain the difference.**
    - Private IP addresses are used within a private network, while public IP addresses are assigned to devices on the internet, making them globally unique.

25. **What are the IP address ranges for private IPs and public IPs? List in tabular form.**

    | Type         | Range                |

28. **What is a MAC Address? What's its need? How does it work?**
    - A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface card for communication on a physical network. It ensures data is sent to the correct device on a local network.


detailed explanations for the specified questions:

2. **How does the internet work?**

   - The internet operates on a packet-switching model, where data is divided into small packets for efficient transmission. These packets travel through various interconnected routers and switches, taking different routes to reach the destination. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) in the TCP/IP suite ensure reliable and standardized communication. For example, when you send a request to a website, the data is broken into packets, each with its own route, and then reassembled at the destination.

3. **What happens when you search something on your web browser/Google.com?**

   - When you enter a query in your web browser and hit Enter, the browser initiates a series of steps. First, it performs DNS resolution to translate the domain name (e.g., www.google.com) into an IP address. Then, a TCP handshake is established with the server. Once connected, an HTTP request is sent to the server, specifying the desired resource (e.g., /search?q=cloud). The server processes the request, retrieves the search results, and sends back an HTTP response. The browser then renders the received data, displaying the search results on your screen.

10. **Explain the OSI model of networking and how it works?**

    - The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model consists of seven layers, each with a specific function. For instance, the Physical layer deals with hardware and transmission media, while the Transport layer ensures reliable end-to-end communication. Consider the example of sending an email: The Application layer deals with the email client, the Presentation layer handles encryption, the Session layer manages the communication session, the Transport layer ensures data integrity, the Network layer routes the email across the internet, the Data Link layer frames the data for local transmission, and the Physical layer deals with the actual transmission medium.

14. **What is the TCP/IP model of networking?**

    - The TCP/IP model is a concise four-layer model. To illustrate, when you send an email using TCP/IP, the Application layer corresponds to the email client, the Transport layer manages reliable communication (TCP for email), the Internet layer handles addressing and routing, and the Link layer deals with local network communication. The TCP/IP model simplifies the networking process, making it more straightforward for practical implementation.

18. **What is UDP model of networking?**

    - UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol ideal for tasks where speed is crucial but occasional data loss is acceptable. For instance, online gaming relies on UDP for real-time communication between players. In this context, if a non-critical piece of game data is lost during transmission, the game prioritizes speed over retransmitting the lost information, resulting in a smoother gaming experience.

20. **Explain how HTTP works?**

    - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) governs the communication between web clients and servers. When you request a webpage (e.g., http://www.example.com), the browser initiates a connection (TCP handshake) with the server on port 80. It then sends an HTTP GET request specifying the resource (/index.html). The server processes the request and responds with an HTTP status code and the requested content. For secure communication, HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is used on port 443, encrypting the data exchanged between the client and server, ensuring privacy and security during data transfer.
