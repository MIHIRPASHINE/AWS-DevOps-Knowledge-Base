   - **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing:** Pay only for the compute capacity you use.

6. **What can developers now do that they could not before AWS EC2?**

   Developers can now access scalable and resizable compute capacity on-demand without the need to invest in and maintain physical hardware. This allows for greater flexibility and agility in deploying applications and services.

7. **List and explain the components of AWS EC2?**

   - **Instances:** Virtual servers running in the cloud.
   - **Amazon Machine Images (AMIs):** Pre-configured templates for instances.
   - **Key Pairs:** Used for secure access to instances.
   - **Security Groups:** Act as virtual firewalls for instances.
   - **Elastic Load Balancers (ELB):** Distribute incoming traffic across instances.

8. **What are EC2 instances?**

   EC2 instances are virtual servers in the cloud that run applications and workloads. They are scalable, customizable, and can be started or stopped as needed.

9. **What is EC2 instance type in AWS? Explain its significance?**

   An EC2 instance type defines the computing and memory capacity of an instance. It determines the resources available to the instance, such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking. Choosing the right instance type is crucial for optimizing performance and cost.

10. **List and explain the EC2 instance types, with their use cases?**

    - **General Purpose (e.g., t3):** Balanced compute, suitable for diverse workloads.
    - **Compute Optimized (e.g., c5):** High-performance computing.
    - **Memory Optimized (e.g., r5):** Memory-intensive applications.
    - **Storage Optimized (e.g., i3):** High, I/O, and storage capacity.

11. **What is Key-Pair in AWS EC2? Explain why do we use it?**

    A key pair in AWS EC2 consists of a public key and a private key. It is used for secure access to instances. The public key is placed on the instance, while the private key is kept secure. Key pairs provide a secure way to connect to and authenticate with instances.

12. **Explain how does AWS Key-pair works?**

    When an EC2 instance is launched with a specified key pair, the public key is stored on the instance, and the private key is used to authenticate and securely connect to the instance. This ensures a secure and encrypted connection between the user and the instance.

13. **List and explain the EC2 instance purchase options, each with their use cases?**

    - **On-Demand Instances:** Pay for compute capacity by the hour with no long-term commitments. Suitable for applications with variable workloads.
    - **Reserved Instances:** Reserve capacity for a 1- or 3-year term, providing significant cost savings compared to On-Demand pricing. Suitable for steady-state or predictable workloads.
    - **Spot Instances:** Bid for unused EC2 capacity, allowing for cost savings but with the possibility of interruption. Suitable for flexible start and end times for workloads.

14. **List and explain the instance state options available in AWS EC2?

   Amazon EC2 instances go through various states during their lifecycle. Here are the common EC2 instance states in AWS and their explanations:

1. **Pending:**
   - **Explanation:** The instance is in the process of being launched. It may be in this state while the system is preparing to run it, such as allocating resources or initializing the instance.

2. **Running:**
   - **Explanation:** The instance is fully launched and running. It is ready to accept and process requests. Charges for running instances are incurred based on the chosen pricing model (On-Demand, Reserved, or Spot).

3. **Stopping:**
   - **Explanation:** The instance is in the process of being stopped. During this state, the instance performs a graceful shutdown, and the data on any attached EBS volumes is saved. The instance can be started again later.

4. **Stopped:**
   - **Explanation:** The instance is stopped and is not actively running. The data on any attached EBS volumes is preserved. Stopped instances do not incur charges for compute resources, but you are billed for any associated EBS volumes.

5. **Shutting Down:**
   - **Explanation:** Similar to the stopping state, the instance is in the process of being shut down. It is in the process of gracefully shutting down before entering the stopped state.

6. **Terminated:**
   - **Explanation:** The instance has been permanently deleted. Once terminated, an instance cannot be restarted. Any associated EBS volumes that were not configured to be deleted on termination are preserved.

7. **Stopping (with Error):**
   - **Explanation:** If there is an issue during the stopping process, the instance may enter a stopping state with an error. This could occur if there are difficulties in the shutdown process.

8. **Terminating (with Error):**
   - **Explanation:** Similar to stopping with error, terminating with error occurs when there are issues during the termination process. This may involve difficulties in cleaning up associated resources.

9. **Hibernating:**
   - **Explanation:** Instances that support hibernation can enter this state. When hibernated, the instance's RAM contents are preserved on the root EBS volume, allowing for faster startup when resumed.

10. **Error:**
    - **Explanation:** Instances may enter an error state due to issues such as resource constraints, misconfigurations, or other problems. Troubleshooting is required to resolve the underlying issues.

Understanding these states is crucial for managing and monitoring EC2 instances effectively. AWS provides tools and services to help automate and streamline the management of instances based on their states.
