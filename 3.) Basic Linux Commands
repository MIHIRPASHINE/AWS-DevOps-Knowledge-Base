Some important linux commands every devops engineer should know:


ls-ltr = list all the files present in the present working directory with timestamp.

sudo = sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy.

sort file.txt = sorts the contents of the file according to the ASCII rules (numerically and alphabatically).

df -h =  df displays the amount of disk space available on all  currently mounted  file  systems (-h is for human readable) 
du -h = disk usage

lsblk = list all the  block storages/volumes attached to the system

free -m = free displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system, as well as the buffer and caches used by the kernel. (memory = RAM)

nano = editing tool inpired by pico editor, often known as legacy editor (ctrl+o to save, ctrl+x to exit)

vi = editing tool used by programmers (press insert for editing mode and esc for non-editing mode, press :wq to save+exit and :q! to exit without saving)

vim = editing tool,viz improved version of vi editor (press insert for editing mode and esc for non-editing mode, press :wq to save+exit and :q! to exit without saving)

wc (word count):
wc -l file.txt= show the no of lines in file.txt
wc -c file.txt= show the no of characters in file.txt
wc -w file.txt= show the no of words in file.txt

tar = GNU  `tar' saves many files together into a single tape or disk archive, and can restore individual files from the archive.

gzip= gzip is used to compress and reduce the size of file
gunzip = used to decompress the files compressed by gzip

scp = secure copy (remote file copy program). scp copies files between hosts on a network.

grep = will catch the files matching the similar pattern as given input.

find / -name sample.txt = will search for sample.txt file under root directory/entire filesystem.

locate= used to indentify the path of  file (use sudo updatedb before using command)

apt = apt is a package manager use to install, update and upgrade the pacakges on debain based distros of linux like ubuntu
apt= advance pacakging tool

yum= yum is a package manager use to install, update and upgrade the packages on red-hat based distros of linux like centos and amazon-linux
yum= yellow-dog update modifier

top= display real-time system updates as well as a list of top consuming processes or threads currently being managed by the Linux kernel.

htop = Htop is a free interactive process viewer for Linux. It  is  similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, so we can see all the processes running on the system.

ps (process status)= reports a snapshot of processes currently being managed by the Linux kernel.
ps -ef = reports snapshot of all processes

kill PID (process ID)= kill is use to terminate the process

(ping = packet internet groper)
ping domain/ip = used to check if connection is established or not/ check the network connectivity over the network.

ip address = used to check the private ip of machine and routing

nslookup domain.com =  Nslookup is a program to query Internet domain name servers.

curl = retrieve the information from internet and displays it on terminal
wget =   GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web. Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background, while the user is not logged on.  This is sometimes referred to as "recursive downloading."

The main difference between them is that curl will show the output on the console. On the other hand, wget will download it into a file.

cron = utility to schedule and automate the execution of commands or scripts at fixed times, day, dates or intervals.
crontab -l = will list the scheduled cron jobs
crontab -e = will open the crontab file and helps to edit it.

Run-levels in linux (0 to 6)
sudo init 0 = will shut-down the system
sudo init 3 = by default we work under runlevel 3 (multi user CLI mode)
sudo init 6 = will stop the system and then restart it.

systemctl = service manager
sudo systemctl status ssh = used to check the status of service
sudo systemctl start ssh = start the service
sudo systemctl enable ssh = enable ssh
sudo systemctl stop ssh = stop service
sudo systemctl restart ssh = restart the service

traceroute domain.com = command used to print the route and time , that a packet takes to reach the host.

telnet domain/ip port =used to check if a specific port is open for a server or not

netstat (network statastics) = networking tool used for troubleshooting and configuration, also use as monitoring tool for connections over the network.
sudo netstat -ntpl = will list which ports are open for the server

awk = awk is a pattern scanning and text processing language used for extracting and processing data in file.
awk, is basically use to segment the output of command to effectively read it.
#Using awk we can retrieve the ouput generated by previous command based on column numbers.
e.g- df -h | awk '{print $1, $4, $5}' = here, awk command will take output generated by df -h command as input, and print the column 1st, 4th and 5th, separately.

nproc = to check the no of cpu's.
